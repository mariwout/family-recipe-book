title: BURRATA WITH FENNEL MARMALADE
---

## Ingrediënten

500 g fennel bulbs, stalks trimmed, fronds reserved

500 ml (2 cups) white wine vinegar

pinch cooking salt

100 g caster sugar

sourdough bread, sliced

burrata, to serve

extra-virgin olive oil

## Benodigdheden

Mandoline

## Bereiding

Using a mandolin, thinly slice the fennel lengthways, placing in a bowl of cold water as you go to prevent oxidation.

Place the vinegar and a good pinch of salt in a wide, heavy based saucepan and bring to the boil. Simmer until reduced by about three quarters. Add the sugar, stir to dissolve, then return to the boil. Move the pan to the largest burner on your stove top.

Drain the fennel, then add to the boiling vinegar mixture. Stirring continuously, cook until the vinegar evaporates. When the vinegar has nearly evaporated, the fennel will begin to glaze and colour so you must stir the fennel continuously to allow for even cooking and caramelisation. Cook until the fennel is golden, glassy and has a jam like consistency. Transfer to a dish immediately to stop the cooking process. Stand to cool slightly.

Drizzle the bread with a little oil and chargrill on both sides until lightly browned. Spread the pickled fennel jam over the base of a serving dish and top with the burrata. Drizzle generously with olive oil and season with salt, then scatter with the reserved fennel fronds.
