title: CLASSIC BRITISH FISH AND CHIPS
---

## Ingrediënten

For the Fish:

7 tablespoons/55 grams all-purpose flour, divided

7 tablespoons/55 grams cornstarch

1 teaspoon baking powder

Sea salt, to taste

1 pinch black pepper, to taste

1/3 cup dark beer, cold

1/3 cup sparkling water, cold

4 (7-ounce) fish fillets (thick, white fish)

For the Chips:

2 pounds potatoes, peeled

1 quart/1 liter vegetable oil (or lard), for frying

## Benodigdheden

## Bereiding

Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.

Mixing flour with spices

Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for between 30 minutes and 1 hour.

Adding beer to the flour mix

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water.

Cut potatoes for chips in a colander

Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.

Par-boiling the cut potatoes

Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.

Drying the potatoes on paper towels

Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.

Drying fish on paper towels

Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the fat for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the fat and drain. Keep to one side.

Frying the potatoes

Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.

Coating the fish with flour

Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.

Dipping the fish into the batter

Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted spoon.

Frying the fish. Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.

Setting the fried fish on paper towels to drain.

Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.

Potatoes are browning as they fry

Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.

## Tips

When making this classic version, be sure to use the freshest cod, pollock, or haddock that you can find for the best results. Frozen fish is also fine, but make sure it is thoroughly defrosted and dried with paper towels first.

Prepare the batter and only dip the fish at the last moment before plunging into hot oil to fry. This way you will always have a light and crisp snap to the batter.

Use a floury potato for the chips. The best varieties are King Edward, Maris Piper, Sante, russet and Yukon Gold.

Why Is Simmering the Potatoes Important?

British "chips" are the same as french fries, and restaurants use a few tricks to make really good and crispy fries. The most important of those are blanching and double frying; the same method used in this recipe. Simmering and the cold water rinse leaves you with blanched potatoes that contain less moisture and will result in crispier fried chips.

Why Do Fish and Chips Get Soggy?

A few factors may result in soggy fish and chips. The first is that the fish and potatoes need to be dry. Removing moisture produces crispier fried food and reduces oil splatter. Oil temperature is also key: If it's too cool, the food needs to cook longer, will soak up more oil, and become soggy. You also don't want it too hot because that can lead to a burnt batter or undercooked fish and potatoes. When deep-frying in a pan, use a thermometer to monitor and maintain the oil temperature. Avoid overcrowding the pan, which will lower the temperature as well.
